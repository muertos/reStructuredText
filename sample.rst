Welcome to the sample rST reference page! This document outlines common
formatting methods used when writing documentation. I encourage you to view
the source of this page to understand how the elements are formatted.

Titles
------

Titles can be created by typing the title name followed by placing certain
symbols below the title.

For example::

    This is a title
    ---------------

I recommend ensuring the length of the line under the title matches the length
of the title.

You can use a number of symbols to create a title::

    =================

    -----------------

    +++++++++++++++++

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first symbol used as a title will have the largest font. All title symbols
used after will be slightly smaller than the largest one.

Subtitle
~~~~~~~~

For example, this is a subtitle of the "Titles" section and uses the ``~``
symbol to create the subtitle.

---------------------

Links
-----

External and internal linking is supported.

Create an external link
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an external link, use the form::

    `Link name <hyperlink target>`_

Example syntax::

    Find out more about InMotion's `Private Cloud <https://www.inmotionhosting.com/cloud/private/hosted>`_ in the Support Center.

Here's how the above syntax would appear after being parsed:

Find out more about InMotion's `Private Cloud <https://www.inmotionhosting.com/cloud/private/hosted>`_ in the Support Center.
